	<p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia, and the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. It is classified in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia, and its closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the continent's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. <span class="koala">It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body, round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.</span> It is popularly known as the "koala bear" because of its bear-like appearance. The koala has a body length of 60-85 cm (24-33 in) and weighs 4-15 kg (9-33 lb). Pelage colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts in the more southern populations. It is possible that these variations are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.</p>
